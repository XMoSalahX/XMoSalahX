Why can I choose to start my journey in the world of programming by creating applications that work on a specific platform such as (Android - iPhone - and different computers - Macintosh) and other devices?

Why don't I study the field to create a service that works on all platforms?

Hence, the beginning was my beginning in the field of web development because of its privileges, including:
• Create websites that respond to all screens, fit the mobile phone and fit the rest of the other devices
• Effective ability to deal with different search engines and produce results based on the quality of the application
• There are many technologies that store website pages for easy loading later, such as (WPA)
And other different features
